Mechanics of game:
==========================

1) Epidemic:
	- Draws bottom card of infection deck
	- if city on card has cubes of city's color, then trigger outbreak mechanic
	- city should have 3 cubes of city's color

2) Infecting cities:
	- check if city has 3 cubes of city's color
		- if true, trigger outbreak mechanic
		- if false, add cube of city's color

3) Outbreak:
	- Occurs when city has 3 cubes of the same color and another cube of that color is added to the city.
		Rather than have >3 cubes, a cube of that color is placed onto each adjacent city
		This can lead to multiple outbreaks
	- City can only outbreak once per player turn

4) Curing:
	- Without cure, player only removes 1 cubes per cure action
	- With cure, player removes all cubes of that color from current city
	- [AFTER DEMO] medic is able to remove all cubes without the cure
		Also able to walk and remove cubes with 1 action if cure for that color is found





=====================================
On card draw, rather than have the card's name be checked, what if each card has a "Card_Draw_Effect" method that triggers whenever the card is drawn?
This would eliminate the need to run a string match or check to see what the card is.

E.g. For player deck, 3 types of cards can be drawn: 
			1) city
			2) event
			3) epidemic

		for 1) and 2) the effect would be to simply continue the game phase
		for 3) it wuold trigger the epidemic game phase

	 For infection deck, only 1 type of card can be drawn:
	 		1) city

	 	for 1) colored cube matching drawn card's color is added to city
	 			- special case is if the card is drawn as an epidemic card
	 			- maybe have another method specific to epidemic? "Epidemic_Card_Draw_Effect" method?

I like this approach more because you don't need to run through a bunch of if statements to progress the game. 

05/30/2018 - EDIT
Actually, you only need 1 check, to see if it's an epidemic card -.-

For deck.Draw_Card(): if epidemic card, then trigger epidemic, else, add card to player hand
==========================================

3 Phases:

1 Player Phase:
	- player completes up to 4 actions
	- player draws 2 cards from the player deck
		- if epidemic: trigger epidemic
			-pull last card from infection deck
			-check card.city
			-check location
